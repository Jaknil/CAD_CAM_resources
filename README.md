# CAD and CAM teching resources

Various CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) resources for fusion 360 and similar programs. 

## Intro to Fusion360 Course - Design a Makercoin for 3D printing

This is my introduction course to parametric CAD which teaches the basics of Fusion 360 to complete beginners and gives them something that will print easily and quick on a standard 3D printer.

It introduces the basic concepts and has a small video were the students can learn the names of more compex tools so that they know that more exists.

## Designing simple wooden furniture in Fusion 360

This cource assumes that you have taken the makercoin course first.

This is a more advanced course that aims to teach beginners how to design a simple stool for laser cutting or CNC milling.

## CNC Milling with Vcarve

Introduction course to CNC milling with a Shopbot using the Vcarve "2D milling" software, for beginners. No CAD skills needed. Made for [Bitraf](bitraf.no)

#### Course ourcome, reflections and feedback

This course turned out to be "heavier" than intended and I fear that some students got intimidated by the prospect of doing all this themselves after the course. 
I believe that this course material should be reworked to first focus on simple shapes and designs and to show how to manufacture them before increasing the 
difficulty step by step to have multi-piece parts and assemblies, if there is time. 

For a beginner the CAM envirounment in Fusion360 is needlessly overwhelming with it's many options and tweaks. 
I recommend that beginners use something simpler, like Vcarve to learn the basics of CAM and CNC operation. 

## Introduction to 3D CAD (various programs) and 3D printing products

This material was developed for a batchelor level course at [Westerdals school of arts communication and technology](https://kristiania.no/westerdals/), which now is a part of [Kristiania University College (HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania)](https://kristiania.no). 

The aim of the course was for the students to learn basic 3D modelling and 3D printing in a CAD program of their choice and they were recommended to choose from 
TinkerCAD, Onshape and Fusion360. To show of their new skills the students designed, printed and documented an unique ice cream serving bowl.

### Course ourcome, reflections and feedback

The students interest in the subject, previous experience levels and ambitions varied greatly. 
The course was set up to accomodate this by letting the students themselves choose the CAD program that they wanted to use. 
Since the students used different programs I first did few general CAD lectures and then focused more on assisting with problems and specific questions. 
The intent was letting the CAD learning be more organic and student challange driven. 

For some this worked fine and it allowed them to go off in their own directions and explore the parts of the programs that appealed to them rather than following a fixed structure.
This format was however disliked by several students who left feedback that they would have preffered more lecture focused teaching and many choose not to attend the CAD-sessions which didn't have a specific lecture theme.


When teaching 3D printing to people I think it's incredibly usefull to make them start printing tests early so that they realise how long time it takes and get them experimenting and learning from the results.
I don't think encouraging this is enough, many will be scared to try and will delay it anyway, I recommend making early tests mandatory.
